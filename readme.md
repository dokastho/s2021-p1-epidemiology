diseases tend to mutate. Suppose there is a disease that reliably mutates after one transmission. Let us further assume that we live in a region that is testing for this disease on a consistent timescale. This is convenient, as we can track superspreaders in a community by assigning the earliest case of this diseases particular genome sequence as a relative patient zero, and anyone else with this disease's same genome sequence as having been infected by this patient zero. The patient zero would spread this disease with a particular genome sequence, and anyone having been infected by this person would then spread a mutated variant of the disease, whereby becoming patient zero for that mutation.

This program takes as input a newline-delimited list of positive tests, with each line being space delimited of the patient's first and last name, the time of their test, and the genome sequence of their varient of the disease. We will use this program to trace the spread of the disease back to the source, as well as hypothesizing how the disease would have spread in the absence of 1) the first infected individual and 2) the worst super spreader
